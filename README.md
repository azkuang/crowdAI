# crowdAI
Implemented a CrowdAgent child class, inheriting from an abstract class NPCAbilities to simulate individual NPC behaviors. The script controls NPC’s movements using Unity’s NavMeshAgent for pathfinding.
Developed a CrowdCluster script for generating multiple NPCs to populate the environment with diverse agents. Utilized Unity’s instantiation methods to create a variable number of NPCs, with different behaviors and movement patterns.
Embedded a reaction system in NPCs to stop and animate using Unity’s Animator. 
Programmed a reset mechanism to resume NPC movement after a fixed duration.

Only Scripts uploaded
